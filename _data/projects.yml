  description: CREEC (Carbon in Riparian Ecosystems Estimator for California) is a web app built for californian ecologists to estimate how much carbon is available in a geographic location based on numerous parameters. It is built using JQuery/JQueryUI elements using a PHP backend.

  description: A Style Experience is a wordpress website built for a small startup entrepreneur in my area. The site aims at drawing customers with it's sleek, modern design. This was my first foray into buiding a website that was easily editable and could endure through many iterations. There isn't much custom code here as it uses mostly pre-built wordpress themes however, this was my attempt at making a beautiful and arts-y, yet functional website.
